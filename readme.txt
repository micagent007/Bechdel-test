In this repo we have:

- audio_res: File sources (some random mp3/wav files to test with)

- WavAndLabelCreator.py: This code creates a wav and Label raw objects. They are the processed audio (an ndArray) and the labels with "who talked when" (an array of 
touples)

- WavAndLabelProcessor.py: This code will process the wav and Label to for example, create a wav file for each person with all they said

- main2: just ignore it for now, it was an experiment

- rawObjects: We will create the rawObjects here

- processesed_audio_res: We will put the processed audio here
