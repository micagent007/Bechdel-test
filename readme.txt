To run the file, 

- Install all libraries

- If there are not any gmm's, you have to add the training data in the package (this can be done by adding the contents of this drive
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TpXdHmjglwLXyioNUKnr8edXmmdXblbW?usp=sharing in the same folder as the main file)

- In main you have to write the absolute address to the wav file to analyse (modifying wav_files_address) and add a resources/processed_audio_res
folder if not already done
 
- Finally you can run the code to obtain the wav split by different voices (indicating gender) in resource/processed_audio_res, and the film in the same package


WARNING:
- If the FilmCreator libraries give problems, the Film creator file can be removed/ignored
- The addresses can give problems (they were based in Linux, so there may be problems with "/" vs "\\")
- It is crutial to have the resources/processed_audio_res in the package, so it is recommended to directly paste the resources file obtained from the drive to the
package before starting


The data used will be in the following drive folder:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TpXdHmjglwLXyioNUKnr8edXmmdXblbW?usp=sharing
